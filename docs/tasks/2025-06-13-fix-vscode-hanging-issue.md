# Task: Fix VSCode Hanging Issue

**Date:** 2025-06-13

## Problem

VSCode hangs when opening the dev container, specifically with the message "Reactivating terminals...". This occurs even after clearing the VSCode terminal state and rebuilding the container.

## Hypothesis

The issue might be caused by a conflict with VSCode extensions being installed. The base Python dev container image likely includes the standard Python extensions, and explicitly defining them in `devcontainer.json` could be causing a problem.

## Plan

1.  **Analyze `devcontainer.json`:** Review the configuration to understand the base image, features, and customizations.
2.  **Modify `devcontainer.json`:**
    *   Keep the `java` feature as it is required for Firebase Emulators.
    *   Remove the `ms-python.python` and `ms-python.debugpy` extensions from the `customizations` section, as they are likely included in the base Python image.
3.  **Rebuild Container:** The user will rebuild the dev container to apply the changes.
4.  **Verify:** The user will check if the hanging issue is resolved after the rebuild.

## Actions Taken

*   Modified `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to remove the redundant Python extensions.

## Next Steps

*   User to rebuild the dev container.
*   If the issue persists, further investigation will be needed. Possible areas to look into:
    *   The `postCreateCommand`.
    *   Potential conflicts with other features (`node`, `firebase-cli`).
    *   Default settings from the base image's pre-installed extensions.

## Update (2025-06-13)

The user has confirmed that the `postCreateCommand` completes successfully, and the hanging occurs during the "Reactivating terminals..." phase. This suggests the issue is not with the installation commands but with the terminal initialization itself.

### New Plan

1.  **Update Task Documentation:** Add the new information to this file. (Done)
2.  **Simplify Terminal Configuration:** Modify `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to explicitly set the integrated terminal's shell to `/bin/bash`. This may resolve potential conflicts or ambiguities in the terminal setup.
3.  **Set Default Python Interpreter:** To prevent the Python extension from searching for a non-existent virtual environment, explicitly set `python.defaultInterpreterPath` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to `/usr/local/bin/python`.

Critical piece of information:

 ```

## Final Solution

The issue was resolved by clearing the workspace interpreter settings in VSCode.

**How I fixed the issue:**
1. Open the VSCode Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
2. Type and select "Python: Clear Workspace Interpreter Settings".
3. Then, you might also want to try "Developer: Reload Window" or completely close and reopen VSCode.
