# Plan: Implement Core React UI

This task covers the initial implementation of the GabChat user interface using React.

## Phase 1: Authentication Flow

1.  **Integrate Firebase:**
    *   Install the `firebase` package in the `src/react-app` directory.
    *   Create a Firebase configuration file (`src/react-app/src/firebaseConfig.js`) to store the Firebase project credentials. I will need to get these credentials. I'll check `docs/LocalSetup.md` to see if they are documented there.
    *   Initialize Firebase in the main application component (`src/react-app/src/main.jsx`).

2.  **Create Authentication Context:**
    *   Create a React Context to manage the user's authentication state (`src/react-app/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`).
    *   This context will provide the current user and methods for signing in and out.

3.  **Build UI Components:**
    *   Create a `SignIn.jsx` component with a "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   Create a `SignOut.jsx` component with a "Sign Out" button.
    *   Update `App.jsx` to conditionally render the `SignIn` component or the main application content based on the user's authentication state.

## Phase 2: API Key Management (Future Task)

*   Create a component to allow users to securely enter and save their Gemini API key. This will likely involve interacting with Firestore.

## Phase 3: Chat Interface (Future Task)

*   Create components for displaying chat messages.
*   Create a component for user input.
*   Implement logic to send messages to the backend and display the LLM's response.
