# Task: Fix CSS `user-select` Warning

**Date:** 2025-06-13

**Status:** In Progress

## Description

A CSS warning was identified in `src/react-app/src/components/SignIn.css`: `[css Warning] Line 2: Also define the standard property 'user-select' for compatibility`. This task is to resolve this warning.

An additional warning was found: `[css Warning] Line 6: Also define the standard property 'appearance' for compatibility`.

## Plan

1.  **Create Task Documentation:** Create this file to document the task.
2.  **Update `TODO.md`:** Add a link to this document in `docs/TODO.md`.
3.  **Implement Fix:** Add `user-select: none;` and `appearance: none;` to the `.gsi-material-button` CSS rule in `src/react-app/src/components/SignIn.css`.
4.  **Verify:** Confirm that the CSS warning is no longer present in the editor.
5.  **Finalize:** Move the task from `docs/TODO.md` to `docs/DONE.md`.
