# GabChat Project TODO

## Frontend Overhaul to React

* The "Sign Out" item in the menu doesn't work (can't click on it)
* Let's use the user profile picture for the user menu instead of a button with the user full name

## Backend

*   [Implement Streaming Backend](tasks/2025-06-13-implement-streaming-backend.md)



## Subsequent Tasks

*   Complete React UI migration (API Key Management, Chat Interface).
*   **(Future Task) Implement E2E UI tests (React):** See [Testing.md](Testing.md) for the detailed plan.
*   **(Future Task) Allow user to select Gemini model:** Implement UI and backend logic for model selection.
*   User session management (beyond simple token verification if needed for React state).
*   CI/CD Integration.
